## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Current Usage
- **Total Storage:** ~220 MB
  - Generated websites: ~19 KB per website
  - Lambda layers: ~192 MB (one-time)
  - Function code: ~17 KB

### Estimated Monthly Cost
```
Storage Cost:
- 220 MB × $0.023/GB = $0.005/month

Request Cost (assuming 1000 websites/month):
- 1000 PUT requests × $0.005/1000 = $0.005
- 1000 GET requests × $0.0004/1000 = $0.0004

Total: ~$0.01/month (essentially FREE!)
```

**Learner Lab Budget:** $50-100  
**Usage:** $0.01/month  
**Remaining:** $49.99-99.99/month 💰

## 🚀 What's Working Now

1. ✅ **Lambda generates HTML** using AI agents
2. ✅ **Lambda uploads to S3** automatically
3. ✅ **S3 serves websites publicly** with direct URLs
4. ✅ **Users can access websites** instantly via HTTPS
5. ✅ **No local file storage needed** - everything in cloud
6. ✅ **Automatic cleanup possible** with lifecycle policies

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 1: CORS Configuration (for frontend)
```powershell
# Enable CORS for React frontend access
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket website-gen-lambda-20251008222203 --cors-configuration file://s3-cors-config.json
```

### Phase 2: Lifecycle Policy (auto-cleanup)
```powershell
# Auto-delete websites older than 30 days
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket website-gen-lambda-20251008222203 --lifecycle-configuration file://s3-lifecycle-policy.json
```

### Phase 3: CloudFront Distribution (CDN)
- Faster global access
- HTTPS by default
- Custom domain support
- Caching for better performance

### Phase 4: Website Metadata Tracking (DynamoDB)
- Track generated websites
- Analytics dashboard
- Popular template tracking
- User session management
